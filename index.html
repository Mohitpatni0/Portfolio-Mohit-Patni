                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted in-depth studies of the latest literature and standards related to 5G technology, with a particular focus
                        on the paper “Deployment of 5G Core for 5G Private Networks*” which explores the simulation of 5G networks and the identification of potential vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li>Successfully simulated a 5G network environment using Open5GS, establishing a functional connection between UERANSIM and gNodeB nodes. This setup facilitated the transfer of files between the two nodes, enabling the detailed analysis of network packets using Wireshark to identify security gaps.
